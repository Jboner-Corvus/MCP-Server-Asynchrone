# Exclude the run.sh script from language statistics
run.sh linguist-generated

# You might also want to exclude other configuration or build-related files if they skew results
# For example, Dockerfile is already low, but if it were higher you could exclude it:
# Dockerfile linguist-generated

# If you have a separate folder for deployment scripts or generated files, you can exclude them:
# deployment_scripts/ linguist-generated
# generated_files/ linguist-generated
